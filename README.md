# cybersecurity-Task-5


## Objective
 Capture live network packets and identify basic protocols and traffic types.

---

## Tool Used
- Windows Packet Monitor (`pktmon`)
    -> **Note: Npcap Installation Issue**
Due to an unresolved system error, I was unable to install **Npcap**, which is required for using **Wireshark**. Despite multiple attempts to fix the issue, the installation failed consistently.
As a temporary alternative, I completed this task using **Windows Packet Monitor (`pktmon`)**, a built-in Windows command-line tool that allows packet capture without the need for external drivers.
I am continuing to troubleshoot the Npcap installation issue, and if resolved in the future, I will update this repository with a Wireshark-based capture and analysis.
For now, the analysis and protocol identification have been done using logs generated by `pktmon`, and the results reflect a valid packet capture exercise as per the taskâ€™s objective.

- OS: Windows 11

##  Capture Process
1. Started capture using: `pktmon start --etw -p 0` Command in Administrator Command Prompt
2. Visited websites
3. let in run for 2 Min
4. Stopped capture using: `pktmon stop`Command in Administrator Command Prompt
5. Converted `.etl` log to `.txt` using: cmd  pktmon format pktmon.etl -o capture-task5.txt
6. Identify at least 3 different protocols in the capture

##  Protocols Identified in Packet Capture

### 1. TCP (Transmission Control Protocol)
- **Purpose**: Provides reliable, connection-based communication between devices.
- **Evidence**: Seen in the logs as multiple connections to web servers over ports like 443 (HTTPS) and 80 (HTTP).
- **Observation**: Handshake patterns and established connections indicate TCP traffic between browser and websites.

---

### 2. ICMP (Internet Control Message Protocol)
- **Purpose**: Used for diagnostics like ping tests.
- **Evidence**: Logged when the `ping 8.8.8.8` command was run during capture.
- **Observation**: Packets with echo request and reply types were recorded, confirming ICMP usage.

---

### 3. DNS (Domain Name System)
- **Purpose**: Resolves human-readable domain names into IP addresses.
- **Evidence**: Requests were seen when accessing websites like google.com or youtube.com.
- **Observation**: Queries to port 53 and responses from DNS servers were part of the initial traffic.

---

###  Summary
Despite using `pktmon` instead of Wireshark, the packet logs clearly showed evidence of:
- Web traffic via **TCP**
- Network diagnostics via **ICMP**
- Domain resolution via **DNS**

This demonstrates how even basic tools can help analyze real-world protocol usage.
